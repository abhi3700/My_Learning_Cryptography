# StarkNet

## About

- StarkNet is a zk-STARKs based layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum.
- `Cairo` is the first Turing-complete language for creating provable programs for general computation. Previously based on Python, now based on Rust.
- It enables us to write smart contracts in cairo, called StarkNet contracts. E.g. [ERC20 token](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/d485f5ffd0c444d900cdcac57b9e745dcc280fba/crates/cairo-lang-starknet/test_data/erc20.cairo).
- `Cairo` based on rust (previously python). [crate](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/d485f5ffd0c444d900cdcac57b9e745dcc280fba/crates/cairo-lang-starknet).
