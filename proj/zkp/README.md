### zk-SNARK

- zk-SNARK stands for zero-knowledge succinct **non-interactive** argument of knowledge.
- depends on elliptic-curves.
- trusted setup is required. This means that the keys (b/w proof required for sending private txn & verification) are generated by a trusted party. So, these secrets need to be destroyed or else the secrets could be utilized to forge transactions by false verifications, giving the holder the ability to perform actions such as creating new tokens out of thin air and using them for transactions.
- Once quantum computing is largely available, the privacy technology behind SNARKs would be broken. So, zk-SNARKs are not quantum-resistant.
- SNARK was the 1st to come to the market before STARK.
- txn cost for zk-SNARK is 24% of zk-STARK.
- on-chain proof size for zk-SNARK is much smaller than zk-STARK.

### zk-STARK

zk-STARK stands for zero-knowledge scalable **transparent** argument of knowledge.
