### zk-SNARK

- zk-SNARK stands for zero-knowledge succinct **non-interactive** argument of knowledge.
- depends on elliptic-curves.
- trusted setup is required. This means that the keys (b/w proof required for sending private txn & verification) are generated by a trusted party. So, these secrets need to be destroyed or else the secrets could be utilized to forge transactions by false verifications, giving the holder the ability to perform actions such as creating new tokens out of thin air and using them for transactions.
- Once quantum computing is largely available, the privacy technology behind SNARKs would be broken. So, zk-SNARKs are not quantum-resistant.
- SNARK was the 1st to come to the market before STARK.
- Better documentation & community support.
- txn cost for zk-SNARK is 24% of zk-STARK.
- on-chain proof size for zk-SNARK is much smaller than zk-STARK.
- A `Rust` lib called [bellman](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman) which uses zk-SNARK.
- A `JS` lib called [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) which uses zk-SNARK.
- A language called [Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) which helps in writing the cryptographic circuits behind zk-SNARKs.
  > Also, comes with a compiler called `Circom compiler` which compiles the circuit into a `R1CS` file and a program (in C++ or wasm) to efficiently compute a valid assignment to all wires of the circuit. Refer [this](#circom) for more.

### zk-STARK

- zk-STARK stands for zero-knowledge scalable **transparent** argument of knowledge.
- depends on hash function.
- That's why quantum-resistant unlike SNARK where it depends on encryption like elliptic-curves.
- less documentation
- txn cost for zk-SNARK is 24% of zk-STARK.
- on-chain proof size for zk-SNARK is much smaller than zk-STARK. That being said, STARKs have far larger proof sizes than SNARKs, which means that verifying STARKs takes more time than SNARKs and also leads to STARKs requiring more gas.
- funded by Ethereum Foundation with 12M USD.
- A language called [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) which helps in writing the cryptographic circuits behind zk-STARKs.

## Languages

There has been many languages developed to help in writing the cryptographic circuits behind zkp. Here are some of them:
