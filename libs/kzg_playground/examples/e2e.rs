//!
//! Creating a Rust-based implementation for KZG proofs with the BLS12_381 curve
//! is a sophisticated task that involves several components, including elliptic
//! curve operations, cryptographic pairings, and the KZG polynomial commitment
//! scheme. To get started, you'll typically need to use a cryptographic library
//! that supports these features.
//!
//! Code
//! ====
//!
//! Outline
//! -------
//!
//! 1. KZG setup
//! 2. Committing to a polynomial
//! 3. Opening a commitment
//! 4. Verifying an opening
//!
//! Details
//! -------
//!
//! Here is a basic outline of how we could start implementing KZG proofs in
//! Rust, using the `bls12_381` and `group` crates for elliptic curve
//! operations. This is a simplified example and serves as a starting point:
//!
//! 1. **Add Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary crates in your
//!    `Cargo.toml`. You might need more depending on your specific
//!    requirements. ```toml [dependencies] bls12_381 = "0.5.0" group = "0.11.0"
//!    ff = "0.11.0" ```
//!
//! 2. **Basic Setup**: Initialize the basic structure for the KZG
//!    implementation. ```rust use bls12_381::{G1Projective, Scalar}; use
//!    group::{Curve, Group}; use ff::Field;
//!
//!    pub struct KZGSettings {
//!        // This will include your KZG setup parameters
//!        // For example, public parameters for KZG
//!    }
//!
//!    impl KZGSettings {
//!        pub fn new() -> Self {
//!            // Initialize your KZG settings here
//!            // This could include generating public parameters
//!            KZGSettings {
//!                // Initialization parameters
//!            }
//!        }
//!
//!        // Add more methods as needed, e.g., for commitment, opening,
//! verification    }
//!    ```
//!
//! 3. **Commitment Function**: Implement the commitment function for a
//!    polynomial. ```rust impl KZGSettings { pub fn commit(&self, polynomial:
//!    &[Scalar]) -> G1Projective { // Implement the KZG commitment algorithm //
//!    This will involve operations on the group elements } } ```
//!
//! 4. **Opening and Verification**: Implement functions for opening and
//!    verifying proofs. ```rust impl KZGSettings { // Opening a commitment at a
//!    specific point pub fn open(&self, polynomial: &[Scalar], point: Scalar)
//!    -> G1Projective { // KZG opening algorithm }
//!
//!        // Verifying a commitment
//!        pub fn verify(&self, commitment: &G1Projective, point: Scalar, value:
//! Scalar, proof: &G1Projective) -> bool {            // KZG verification
//! algorithm        }
//!    }
//!    ```
//!
//! 5. **Testing**: Implement tests to ensure your KZG scheme works correctly.
//!    ```rust #[cfg(test)] mod tests { use super::*;
//!
//!        #[test]
//!        fn test_commitment() {
//!            // Test your commitment function
//!        }
//!
//!        #[test]
//!        fn test_verification() {
//!            // Test the verification of a commitment
//!        }
//!    }
//!    ```
//!
//! This is a very high-level overview and doesn't include the actual
//! implementation details of the KZG scheme, as those are complex and require a
//! deep understanding of the underlying mathematics. You would need to fill in
//! the logic for each method based on the KZG polynomial commitment scheme,
//! handling the intricacies of polynomial representations, group operations,
//! and pairings.
