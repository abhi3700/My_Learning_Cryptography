//! Elliptic curve maths with real numbers
//!
//! In maths, we can perform operations like P + Q with real numbers.
//! But in cryptography, it's done within [`Finite Field (FF)`] with a
//! large prime number and that's the assumption we make in cryptography.
//!
//! When done with large prime number, then the operations like add, div
//! follows [`modulo arithmetic`].
//!
//! [`Objective`]: Determine the R such that `P + Q + R = 0`, a property of ECC.
//!
//! Then, consider the different cases for these 2 points (P, Q) that are falling
//! on a straight line where,
//! 1. either P or Q is zero
//! 2. if P = Q (are same)
//! 3. if P â‰  Q (are different)
//!
//! --P-------Q-------R-----
//! Basically, there is a straight line that is crossing the curves at 3 points (P, Q, R) on
//! one side of x-axis (preferably upper side).
//! Then, the reflection of the 3rd point on x-axis is `-R`.
