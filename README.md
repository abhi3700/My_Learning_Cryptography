## Concepts

- **RSA vs ECC**
  - RSA is based on integer factorization problem, while ECC is based on discrete logarithm problem.
  - RSA has lower key size than ECC.
  - RSA key generation is slower than ECC, but verification of the former is faster than the latter => 20000 RSA vs 8000 ECC key verification.
  - RSA is simpler to implement than ECC, also the former is less expensive to implement.
    > Now, that quantum computer research has advanced, ECC is more secure than RSA, but it still can be broken by quantum computers. So, the researchers are working on quantum resistant cryptography.
- Generating a **private key from a mnemonic passphrase** is a two-step process:

  1. **Seed generation**: There is a <kbd>mnemonic passphrase (12 to 24 words)</kbd> -> <kbd>512-bit seed</kbd> using the BIP-39 algorithm.
  2. **Private key generation**: <kbd>512-bit seed</kbd> seeded with <kbd>PRNG</kbd> -> <kbd>256-bit private key</kbd>

  > This private key can then be used for a wide variety of purposes such as creating digital signatures, generating public/private key pairs and deriving key pairs for encryption.

- **Hash functions**

- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)**
  - Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields.
  - It has ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) algorithms for key exchange and digital signatures respectively.
    - ECDH is used for key exchange i.e. to share a secret key between two parties i.e. for Alice and Bob to share a secret key. `private_key_A \* public_key_B = shared_secret_key = private_key_B \* public_key_A`

- Python cryptography - [Github](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) , [Website](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)
- **Deprecated** PyCrypto - [Github](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto), [Website](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/) DON'T USE THIS...
- PyCryptodome: A fork of PyCrypto (after version 2.6.1) - [Github](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome), [Website](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) . Read the [blog](https://blog.sqreen.io/stop-using-pycrypto-use-pycryptodome/) which recommends using the new library as the old one is prone to hacking.
