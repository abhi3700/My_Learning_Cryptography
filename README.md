Learn about cryptography concepts - Both basics and core covered here.

## Books
* Hacking using python - https://inventwithpython.com/hacking/
* Handbook of Applied Cryptography - http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/


## Software tools
* Python Crypto Cheatsheets - https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/python-crypto.html
* Python cryptography - [Github](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) , [Website](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)
* **Deprecated** PyCrypto - [Github](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto), [Website](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/) DON'T USE THIS...
* PyCryptodome: A fork of PyCrypto (after version 2.6.1) - [Github](https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome), [Website](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) . Read the [blog](https://blog.sqreen.io/stop-using-pycrypto-use-pycryptodome/) which recommends using the new library as the old one is prone to hacking.
* pyDes: a library for DES symmetric encryption algorithm - [Github1](https://github.com/toddw-as/pyDes), [Github2](https://github.com/RobinDavid/pydes), [pip package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyDes/)
* pyaes: a library for AES symmetric encryption algorithm - [Github](https://github.com/ricmoo/pyaes).
* Python-RSA: a library for RSA i.e. assymetric algorithm - [Github](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa)
